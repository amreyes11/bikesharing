# Challenge 15


Overview

Since there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, I will provide more informative graphs to show the positivity it will have in the desired location.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

  * Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  * Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  * Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.


Results

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Using Python and Pandas functions, the "tripduration" column transitioned from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After the conversion, update "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, and then save the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:
  * How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  * How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
  * A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
